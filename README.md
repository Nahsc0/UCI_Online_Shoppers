# UCI Online Shoppers Analysis

This repository contains the code and data for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Predictive Analysis on the UCI Online Shoppers dataset.

## Project Overview

The UCI Online Shoppers dataset contains information about online shoppers' demographics, their visit patterns, and their purchasing behavior. This project aims to analyze this data to gain insights into customer behavior and predict future purchasing patterns.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes demographic information about the shoppers, their visit patterns, and their purchasing behavior.

## Methodology

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In this part, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to understand the underlying patterns and structures. This includes calculating descriptive statistics, visualizing the data, and performing correlation analysis.

2. **Predictive Analysis:** In this part, we use the EDA findings to build predictive models. These models are used to predict future purchasing patterns based on the shoppers' demographic information and visit patterns.

## Usage

To run the analysis, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the R scripts in the following order:

1. `eda.R`: This script performs the EDA on the dataset.
2. `predictive_analysis.R`: This script performs the predictive analysis using the results of the EDA.

## Results

The results of the analysis are saved in the `results` directory. The EDA results include descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation matrices. The predictive analysis results include model summaries and predictions.
